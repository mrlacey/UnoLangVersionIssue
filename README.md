# UnoLangVersionIssue

This is a simple, minimal reproduction of an issue reported at https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues/9130


## Reproduction

When `LangVersion` is specified as `latest` the source generator within the package does generate files.

However, when the `LangVersion` is specified as `10.0` no files are generated.

**Note 1.** In both of the above cases, the compiler completes successfully and reports no warnings or errors.

**Note 2.** Because of the way Visual Studio caching works, it _may_ be necessary to clean the solution and restart VS to see this behavior.

**Note 3.** While not immediately obvious from this repro, this was discovered in a more complex solution that has code (separate soruce generators) which relies on the code whihc should have been generated by `Uno.UI`.
